## üéµ Project Overview
NOYZ is an innovative audio NFT marketplace where users can buy, sell, and manage digital audio assets. The platform allows users to listen to audio samples and purchase them as NFTs. Additionally, users can switch to "Artist Mode" to create and upload their own tracks for sale. A royalty system ensures artists earn a percentage from every resale.

### üî• Key Features
- **User Mode:** Sign up, listen to samples, buy music NFTs, and manage a wishlist.
- **Artist Mode:** Upload audio tracks, sell them as NFTs, and earn royalties.
- **Album Creation:** Artists can group multiple tracks into an album and sell them as a collection.
- **Finance Module:** Artists can track total sales, and earnings, and withdraw or deposit funds via a dedicated wallet.
- **Admin Panel:** Manage user accounts, approve artist requests, and control platform activity.
- **Social Features:** Follow favorite artists, track followers, and follow lists.
